Recently we fired our admin responsible for backups. We have the program he wrote to decrypt those backups, but apparently it's password protected. He did not leave any passwords and he's not answering his phone. Help us crack this password!

PS: Challange binary might trigger windows defender with a certain signature database version. It's a false positive, known for quite some time. If you google the signature name, you should be able to find GitHub issue explaining it. It's not malware, although we encourage you to run it on a separate VM.
