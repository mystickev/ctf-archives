aplet: use https://rubiks-cube-solver.com/ to get solve from positions, then invert moves to get scrambles
kmh: starting position w is U R2 F2 R2 D L2 B2 D' F2 D U2 L' R2 U B U F' L2 F R'
aplet: a'wa is B2 D2 U' R2 D U2 B2 L R2 D' U2 L D L2 B L' U L R'
kmh: b'wb is L2 U L2 R2 U F2 D2 F2 R2 U R' U' L' B L2 R D B2 F' R'. interestingly, b by itself only leaves the edges on front-left and front-bottom in their correct positions (although the front-bottom edge is flipped). what are the chances?
aplet: idk but the key is a'b'wba
