RousTel has just released their newest CPU, the RousTel r1337. Using it, rous encrypted the flag with a proprietary algorithm! Fortunately, clam was able to retrieve the proprietary circuit diagram and a memory dump which seems to contain the algorithm and the encrypted flag. Can you figure out how to decrypt it?
