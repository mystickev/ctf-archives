Background story: this code was once used on a REAL site to encrypt REAL data. Thankfully, this code is no longer being used and has not for a long time.

A long time ago, one of the sites I was building needed to store some some potentially sensitive data. I did not know how to use any proper encryption techniques, so I wrote my own symmetric cipher.

The encrypted content in output.bin is a well-known, olde English quote in lowercase ASCII alphabetic characters. No punctuation; just letters and spaces.
