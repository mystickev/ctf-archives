Try pwning this one. You should first test your exploit locally with the file provided and make a fake `flag.txt` in the same directory as `canaries`. After testing locally, you can send the payload to the actual server. Pwntools is very handy for tasks like these. Huge thanks to **AlphaTank#3351** for devising and formulating this challenge.
