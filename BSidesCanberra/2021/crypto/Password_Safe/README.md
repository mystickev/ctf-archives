I've created a fail-safe way to protect my passwords. I've encrypted them with AES and written the key down on a post-it note. Unfortunately, I spilt an energon drink and now can't read the last 2-bytes... can you help?

Partial AES key: 1af7ecfac3596c6425ce4f403c44 Cipher: 3f24b052ee4ce98a849e954d5b0c9859344d870af49b233a78cd83860e339ee4228b1d76b054e9239bf3b3c29d0cef91
