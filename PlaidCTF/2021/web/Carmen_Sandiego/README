Carmen isn't your average thief â€“ in fact, she's trying to save the artifacts she steals! Join Carmen, Player, Zach, and Ivy as they protect the world's cultural history from the likes of VILE, one theft at a time. But they have to be careful: ACME thinks they're on the wrong side of the law and will stop at nothing to bring them to justice.
