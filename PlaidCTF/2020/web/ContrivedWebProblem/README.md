You decide that the only way you’re going to be able to get any rest is to be back in your own bed. You teleport to your house and pull on your PJs. Of course, as soon as you climb under the covers, the day’s events start replaying in your head. You can’t believe how lucky you’ve been so far in the challenges—every single flag has appeared naturally to you as the result of your own curiosity. You didn’t need to force any of them.

Your thoughts were running too fast, so you decide to pull out your phone and scroll through some feeds. As you pull it out, something seems off. You could swear that you had chosen the green case at the store last week. And why is it so triangular? That’s the kind of phone that three-fingered iguana avatars use.

You close your eyes for a second; you really are tired. When you open them again, the phone’s blue. Huh? You close and open them. Red. Close, open. Square. Close, open. Purple and pointy. Who can use a phone like that?

The curious thing is that you’re still able to see your phone screen just fine. Maybe there’s a way to figure this one out, too.
