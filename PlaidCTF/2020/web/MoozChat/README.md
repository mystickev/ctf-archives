After chasing the dog around and around Carnival, you decide to take a walk to cool off. The smell of fried dough wafts past you as you walk back through the rigged games section. Everything looks familiar, but the spot where you found the fortune teller is gone. It’s not like the fortune teller is gone; the spot itself is gone. The pinned throws and the spinning knives are right next to each other as if there was never anything between them. It’s not clear how this is possible, but somehow the world has warped to hide where the fortune teller once was. That’s weird.

You continue to puzzle over this as you continue on to the booths. The Westworld booth looks even more realistic and gruesome up close. You shudder and decide not to go into that one. You don’t need to be throwing around anybody’s brain. Right next to that one, you see one that tickles your fancy a little bit more. The people crowded around this booth are all dressed in silly costumes; dinosaurs, superheroes, robots, secret agents, and more. They all carry weapons and pickaxes of a multitude of designs. As you get closer, you see a bush shift… and then stand up! There was a person inside! The group is a cacophony of noise; each one is dancing to a different short clip of music. One furiously flosses while several dab. Should you join in?

Further along, you see a booth shaped like a giant goose. Around its neck hangs a sign, “Untitled”. You walk into the belly of the goose and see a gardener diligently tending his plants. You manage to steal the keys with your newly-formed beak. Having a neck this long is really handy. You open the gate and continue deeper into the booth…

As you leave the goose, you return to your original size. “Blegh. That tasted awful.” Having to constantly use your mouth to move things around isn't really what you were looking for when you thought of "fun". Looking for a change of pace, you see that Animal Crossing booth that caught your eye earlier. You walk in to see the familiar face of Isabelle, smiling at you and welcoming you to the island. You explore for a little while, catching an oarfish to the applause of those around you, before walking into one of the many houses around.

The inside looks oddly familiar. You puzzle over this for a moment, before realizing that it looks exactly like your house. You walk over to the full-length mirror to admire your Animal-Crossing-ified self. As you’re staring, your Nook phone buzzes. You pull it out, but the screen is blank. Puzzled, you look back up at the mirror, and see your regular face looking back at you. You (the other you) is trying to say something, but you (the not other you) can’t make it out.

“... people are hack… REFUGE … safe …”

The other you looks frantic, and is getting more frantic as they can see that you aren’t getting it. Suddenly, the other you tilts sideways and your view of them splits in half. Bits and pieces of the other you move around, while some stay in place. In an instant, the fragmented world disappears and you’re left staring at your own reflection.

You decide to puzzle over your Nook phone to see if you can figure out how you triggered the vision.
