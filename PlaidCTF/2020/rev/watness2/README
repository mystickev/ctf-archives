You think you’ve found everything in the back of the library, so you head back to the front, and find yourself in a section far more traditional than the one in which you started. You’re not really sure where to begin, so you just pull a random book off the shelf to see if there’s any useful information inside.

Flipping to the first page, you’re not greeted with words, but what you can only describe as a window to another location entirely. It looks like some kind of garden? You’re not completely certain, but for some reason you feel compelled to place your palm to the image.

At one moment, you’re in the library, holding a book. The next, you’re in a dark tunnel, with no books in sight. Confused, you wander towards the light, only to find the garden you were looking at only seconds ago.

A few steps away, you see an older man dressed in plain robes running his finger against a panel. He seems troubled by something. Curious, you approach him.

“Hi there”, you say.

“Hello my friend”, he responds. He doesn’t look at you; he’s completely engrossed in what he’s doing.

The card in front of him has a grid on it, and he seems to be drawing paths along the edges to connect certain points. It looks like he’s almost done, but then he shakes his head and backtracks almost all the way to the start. There must be some rules you’re not getting here. But, you feel certain that if you can figure those rules out, a flag will be yours.
