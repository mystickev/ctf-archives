Feeling stifled by the large crowd gathered in the entrance plaza, you open up your minimap and try to find somewhere to search far away from the entrance gate. Ah, perfect—there’s some kind of library on the other side of the Sanctum. A nice, quiet place to search alone for a bit.

Entering the library, you find that your guess the library would be quiet was… rather faulty. As the door swings closed behind you, instead of a soft bell that one might expect to hear, you’re greeted with the wail of an electric guitar, quickly followed by some heavy drums. Perhaps not a great place to sit quietly, but at least it seems like you’ve got the place to yourself!

You find yourself drawn to a section labeled “anime” (perhaps this is some sort of multimedia collection?), and everything there is spinning and flashing and generally making your eyes hurt a little. But there’s got to be a flag hiding somewhere behind the seizure-inducing mess, right?
