Digging around in all those fish took a lot out of you. As you bend over to take a seat on a curb, you see a monkey crouching right in front of you. Skin purple, eyes too close together, the monkey smiles.

“Hey, what are you doing here?”

“I’m just here to help you out,” the monkey replies. “I’m Bonzi. How can I help?”

Bonzi reaches his hand out to you. You really could use a friend right about now. Everything is so confusing, and you have no idea what’s happening with REFUGE. How is it that the one silly little challenge caused everything to go haywire?

You smile back at Bonzi. Maybe they need a friend too.
