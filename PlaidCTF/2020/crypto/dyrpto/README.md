You decide to return to the Carnival to see if you can find the fortune teller again. As you’re searching, you mull over the fortune teller's words, “swollen tongue… jumbled vision… burning rubber… a bark… waves passing…”, and you trip over a dog beneath your feet. It’s a black dog, pointy ears, a little scruffy. A scottish terrier! How cute.

The dog looks at you and you look back at the dog. It’s small and its tail is wagging. It seems not at all out of place among the hustle and bustle of Carnival. You squat down and reach your hand out.

“Here doggy. Nice doggy.”

The dog comes forward and sniffs your hand, allowing you to give him a scratch on the head. As you continue to scratch, you feel something remarkably smooth. You wonder what it could be. You bend over to take a closer look and the dog senses your interest, tensing. Just as you’re about to pull a flag out of its collar, it pulls free of your grip and darts away.

“Hey! Come back, doggy.”

You begin to chase after it, but lose the dog in the crowd. To your surprise, you discover a sheet of paper left in your hand. You see that most of it is torn off, but it looks like the beginning of something useful. Looking around again, you spot the scotty dog and dash after it.
