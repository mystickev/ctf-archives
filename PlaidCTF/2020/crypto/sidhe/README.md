Feeling a little down on your luck and wondering where the next flag is going to be, you sit down to take a break. You’ve made a lot of progress so far, but it seems like there’s still going to be a lot of flags left to find. You lower your head to rub it with your hands, and play with your hair a little. It’s easy enough to mess up, but you bought the auto-hair-fixer a while back in a moment of weakness.

“Hello, dearest. You’re looking a little down. How can I pick you up?”

You look up and see no one. The voice sounded warm and friendly, but you can’t see anyone around. Out of the corner of your eye, you spot a fluttering bird. Except its wings are gossamer like those of a dragonfly. And its body looks like a tiny human.
