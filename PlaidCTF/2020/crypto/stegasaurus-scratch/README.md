Entering the Inner Sanctum, the first thing that catches your eye is the very large dinosaur skeleton fountain right in the middle of the plaza, beyond the entrance gate. While your knowledge of dinosaurs is… mixed at best, the plates on its back immediately give it away as a stegosaurus.

That's cool and all, but what exactly does that have to do with Bovik? Besides the fact that he presumably loved dinosaurs, of course.

On further inspection, you notice some inscriptions on the stegosaurus's plates. They're very roughly engraved, like someone was using some kind of hand tool to etch them into the bone. Or maybe… claws? Whatever the case, it seems like too strange of a detail right at the entrance for it not to be important.
