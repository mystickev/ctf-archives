Now that you’re already in the back area, you decide to explore a little bit more. The database room was at the end of the hallway, but along the way you saw a couple of other rooms that piqued your interest. On your way back, you notice a scent you didn’t smell initially. It’s some fresh seasoning that you can’t place. Thyme?

The room turns out to be the librarian’s lounge. You step around the corner only to jump back in fright. There’s someone lying on the couch! You try to calm your racing heart as you process the fact that they’re sound asleep. Drool dribbles down the front of their shirt. As their chest rises, the room vibrates with a massive snore.

Your eyes move past the couch to the back of the room. A small chest sits on the counter, and you can tell the smell is coming from there. Your stomach rumbles as you set to work getting it open.
