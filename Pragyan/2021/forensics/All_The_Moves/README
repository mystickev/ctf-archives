To say I have been struggling recently would be a huge understatement. I have been getting completely crushed by this MVL dude for a long time. I had almost given up hope until I found a very interesting file on his computer when he wasn't around. I know for a fact that they contain data on stuff he does, and I feel could help me, but I have no idea what they mean.

And you know the most frustrating thing. Every time I fail, he is just in my face, just being "o for nothing dude". I mean, if you are gonna insult me, atleast use zero instead man. So annoying.

So, now that you have heard my plight, can you help me decode them?
