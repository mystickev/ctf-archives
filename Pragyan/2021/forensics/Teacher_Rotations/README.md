Hello, my name is Thomas. I currently run a slew of schools with branches all around the country. But, as the owner of multiple schools, I have a very important problem at hand that, if left unsolved, threatens to completely destroy my entire empire.

I have been having a lot of teachers dropping out, either due to covid or for some other bs reason. I am completely sick of these lazy people man. I have had to rotate almost all of these teachers man. I mean, some are fine as is, but man is there are some rotate-heavy people in there. But I feel like this plan can only work if we can sort the teachers in a proper way to profit the company.

Can you help me find out what this could produce?
