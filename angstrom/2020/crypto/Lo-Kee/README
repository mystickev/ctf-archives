The evil organizers aplet and kmh are clearly up to something, but they are using the Ko-Lee key exchange! It seems that they are using the Rubik's Cube as their group. The readable part of their conversations is linked here.

Help me find the key! (Put the position into the cube solver and invert to get the scramble; then wrap the scramble without spaces in actf{}. If the outputted solve was R U R' U', the flag would be actf{URU'R'}.)
